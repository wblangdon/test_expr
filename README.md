# test_expr
Create random inputs for unix expr and answer it should give. 
Uniformly randomly samples binary trees and then converts them to random arithmetic expressions.

Binary trees of a given size can be sampled rapidly uniformly at random

An unlabelled binary is tree is created by random vertical and horizontal moves across
square, starting at corner and moving towards the diagnoally opposite corner
keeping above the diagonal [reading_group_bigtree/langdon_sse_15-jan-2020.pdf](slides).
